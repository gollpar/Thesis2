Globalization, natural disaster, and war have made humans to be in a constant move all over the planet; moving from their houses, believes, and relationships.
Our lives are in such a fast pace, there is no time for distractions, so how can we hold on to thoughts without carrying them all the time? We do that with objects, we do not always carry them but we still have them. How can we do that with thoughts? 

Immigration takes one far away from familiar objects, culture and thoughts. Not being around familiar things, makes one to carry the thought of those familiar things all the time. If one wants to ignore those thoughts and feelings, one might looses a chunk of their identity and a part of who they are. But how can one unburden her/himself from all those thoughts without loosing themselves?


#### Speculative Design:

I am making a speculative world in Dunne and raby class to support my thesis question.

Imagining a world that people do not have to carry their thoughts, instead they can transform them to objects. 

But why objects? Objects are a good way to unload and store thoughts & identity because they donâ€™t require visas! they are truly portable.
